# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

1st Project : Data Cleaning in SQL


This is a project I worked on to practice data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL. The dataset was messy, so I focused on cleaning it up and preparing it for analysis. I followed along with Alex Freberg's tutorial on YouTube to learn these skills.
I tackled data cleaning steps:
  1. Removing Duplicates
  2. Standardizing the Data
  3. Removing NULL vaules/Blank Values
  4. Removing irrelevant Columns

Tools used = MySQL, Kaggle(for data extraction)

 Big thanks to Alex Freberg for his amazing tutorial on SQL!
